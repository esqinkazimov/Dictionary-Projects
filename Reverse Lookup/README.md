The function named reverseLookup finds all of the keys in a dictionary
that map to a specific value. The function will take the dictionary and the value to
search for as its only parameters. It will return a (possibly empty) list of keys from
the dictionary that map to the provided value.

I included a main program that demonstrates the reverseLookup function as part
of solution to this project. The program creates a dictionary and then
shows that the reverseLookup function works correctly when it returns multiple
keys, a single key, and no keys. The main program only runs when
the file containing this project has not been imported into another
program.
