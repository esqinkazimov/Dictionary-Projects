The function simulates rolling a pair of six-sided dice. Function will not take any
parameters. It will return the total that was rolled on two dice as its only result.
The main program uses the function to simulate rolling two six-sided
dice as many times as the user enters. Asprogram runs, it counts the number of times that each
total occurs. Then it displays a table that summarizes this data. It expresses the
frequency for each total as a percentage of the total number of rolls. Program
also displays the percentage expected by probability theory for each total.
