In this project I wrote a program that simulates a game of Bingo for the last
card. It begins by generating a list of all of the valid Bingo calls (B1 through O75).
Once the list has been created it randomizes the order of its elements by calling
the shuffle function in the random module. Then program consume
calls out of the list and cross out numbers on the card until the card contains a winning
line. It simulates 1,000 games and reports the minimum, maximum and average number
of calls that must be made before the card wins.
