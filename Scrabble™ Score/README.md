In the game of Scrabble™, each letter has points associated with it. The total score
of a word is the sum of the scores of its letters. More common letters are worth fewer
points while less common letters are worth more points. The points associated with
each letter are shown below:

One point                  A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U

Two points                 D and G

Three points               B, C, M and P

Four points                F, H, V, W and Y

Five points                K

Eight points               J and X

Ten points                 Q and Z

The program computes and displays the Scrabble™ score for a word.
The dictionary maps from letters to point values. Then the score is computed.
